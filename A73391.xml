         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To beginne then with the entertainement of the doer, <hi>Well done good and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:</hi> In it are two particulars, 1. <hi>Laeta exultatio,</hi> Gods tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in him, <hi>Euge, well: 2. gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſa compellatio,</hi> God's grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

            </p>
            <p>1. God's triumph, <hi>Euge, well;</hi> I finde this word uſed three wayes: Sometime it is <hi>vox a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulantis,</hi> men flatter with it: When we doe any thing that is right, ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> the people are ready to cry <hi>Euge, euge,</hi> well, well, whereby to make us conceit too well of our ſelves, and grow proud. Sometime it is <hi>vox irridentis,</hi> men ſcoffe with it; <hi>Thou ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt againſt my Sanctuary, when it was prophaned, Euge,</hi> Ezek. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 3. <hi>well, now it is as it ſhould be.</hi> Sometime it is <hi>vox exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantis,</hi> men rejoyce with it: let them not ſay, <hi>Euge animae noſtrae,</hi> Pſalm. 35. 25. <hi>our ſoule skips at this, ſo would wee have it.</hi> The firſt way it cannot bee taken here; for God, who is moſt direct in all his dealings, ſlattereth no man, fawneth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no man. Much leſſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173668:7"/> way, for though he mocke the ſcorne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, yet not thoſe of his owne houſhold. But the third way it well befits him, <hi>qui delectatur bono,</hi> as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt fings, <hi>Pſal. 35. 27.</hi> who delighteth in the proſperity of his ſervants, and is merry and glad at their welfare. <hi>Luk. 15. 32.</hi> Therefore ſeeing them give up their account with cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, receives it at their hands with joy, <hi>Euge, well done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This triumph of God's, hath two grounds: 1. The relation wherein he ſtands to them, and they to him: The father joyes at the good of his ſonne; the husband at the good of his wife; one friend at the good of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So God exults and is much affected when his ſervants per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſuch duties as they ought that it may goe wel with them, becauſe he is theirs in all theſe relations; their father, their husband, and their friend. 2. His
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173668:8"/> owne glory, which by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants good employment is much advanced. God indeed is in himſelfe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and from all Eternity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in himſelfe without the acceſſe of men or Angels; but when it pleaſed him to create man, and communicate himſelf unto him, by giving him ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, hee is well pleaſed with that which his grace hath wrought out of himſelfe with the right ordering and diſpoſing of it, receiving the returne of it to him againe with a joyfull <hi>Euge,</hi> oh well is it done.</p>
            <p>The duty that I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force from hence, is this, that every man in his calling ſhould <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. quicken the gift that is in him, to ſtand either Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in ſtead, even upon this encouragement, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in his worthy employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173668:8"/> I remember, <hi>Anſelme</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Anſan. 1 Cor. 6</note> reading thoſe words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 19. Your bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghoſt, which you have of God,</hi> falls upon this diſcourſe; You offend grievouſly if you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane God's Temple, your own body; becauſe, as you would not have your houſe defiled, no more would God have his; <hi>Si vobis igitur non parcitis propter vos ipſos, at parcite vobis propter Deum, quifecit vos Templum ſuum:</hi> If the comfort which your ſelves ſhall thereby reape, cannot move you to ſpare your bodies from pollution yet ſpare them at leaſt wiſe on the behalf of God who hath made them his: So when I looke upon my Text, and ſee God with ſuch hearty affection entertaining mens good endevours, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but inferre thus much, that ſurely we greatly ſinne, if we uſe not our ſtocke aright which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173668:9"/> God hath given us to trade withall, ſince it is his will that his money ſhould be put to the banke, and bring in increaſe. If then the diſcharge of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cannot worke upon us to be induſtrious and painefull in our places, yet let the thought of pleaſing God perſwade us. For how expedient is it for us, that when wee come to reckoning, God ſhould ſmile upon us with a chearefull countenance, and embrace us with an <hi>Euge,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in our good; rather, than that hee ſhould knit his browes, and caſt us off with a <hi>vah</hi> of indignation.</p>
            <p>The point concerneth all men whom God hath adorned with the leaſt talent of ability in any kinde; it more neerely toucheth thoſe who are furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with knowledge, dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yea, and with authority, to doe much good to many, and thereby bring in a large crop
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173668:9"/> into Gods barne at the day of harveſt. Conſider with your ſelves, you that are rulers, and have the government on your ſhoulders, what fruit God may have by youruſing your graces and places aright; what benefit may redound unto his houſhold which hee takes care of: how hee joyes in ſeeing his plough goe by your miniſtery; honour him who hath honoured you; he hath lwone plentifully in his gifts to you, let him reape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly in your increaſe to him; that when he comes into your fields, hee may ſee them ſtand full of corne; when into your Circuits, hee may ſee the torrents and ſtreames of juſtice running downe, and ſo may cheare you up with much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and give you this for a largis <hi>euge,</hi> well have you done. This for God's exultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The compellation followes, <hi>Good and faithfull ſervant:</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:173668:10"/> Where are two things, Mans reference to God, <hi>ſervant:</hi> The qualities where with a right ſervant is adorned, <hi>Good and faithfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Mans reference to God, <hi>ſervant:</hi> It is proper to God to be a Maſter, he hath <hi>propriam &amp; ſingularem conditionem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aquinas,</hi> the true <note place="margin">2. 2. q. 81. reſ. ed 1.</note> ground of Lordſhip, therfore it is proper to man to bee his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: he hath <hi>propriam &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularem conditionem ſervitutis,</hi> the true ground of ſervice. The foundation of this relation is twoſold: 1. God's making all things; ſo man is a ſervant to him, <hi>ſecundum conditionem,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> in regard of his very being; every worke oweth this to the maker, that it is to be ſubject unto, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by him: 2. God's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality over all things; every inferiour is ſervant to his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; the Curator to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſull,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173668:10"/> the Proconſull to the Emperour, and all to God, who is <hi>primus,</hi> the firſt and chiefe, in and by whoſe vertue and power all things move. This reference to God is ſo rooted and ſetled in our nature, that his ſervants wee are whether we will or no his ſervants, <hi>de jure,</hi> he hath command of us; I, and <hi>de neceſsitate</hi> too, he will have the rule of us, making us by his ineffable diſpoſition, that wee can doe nothing but what hee wils, or ſuffers to bee done, though <hi>de fact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>His ſervants wee all are by theſe bonds, but ſome men ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in a neerer kind; thoſe whom hee hath ſet on worke to ſome notable employment, either in the Church, thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Rom. 1. 1. a ſervant of Chriſt, ſet apart to the Preaching of the Gospell:</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:173668:11"/> or in the Common-wealth; thus is <hi>David</hi> marked out, <hi>Pſ. 89. 20 I have found David my ſervant, with my holy oyle have I anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him:</hi> theſe are not onely God's ſubjects, over whom he rules <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by generall command as a King; but men of his houſhold, whom hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by ſpeciall power as a Maſter, and theſe are the ſervants here ſpoken of. This ſervice of God, it is <hi>bonos</hi> full of dignity, and <hi>onus</hi> full of duty.</p>
            <p>1. Full of dignity; for what more honourable than to ſerve ſo gracious and great a Lord? The Princes and Rulers of the earth content not themſelves with their owne excellencies, but it is their ambition to bee entertained as ſpeciall ſervants to the King. Though a man would wonder that they who in ſome diſtance from the Sunne might ſhine bright themſelves,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173668:11"/> ſhould deſire to bee ſo neare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, by whom their owne ſplendour is much ecclipſed: but it ſeemeth the light of a Kings countenance, and the breath of his noſtrils ſhining comfortably, and breathing ſweetly, is more glorious to men, than all the command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the crouching, reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and obeyſance of meane perſons. And if it be an honour to ſerve a mortall man, how great ſoever; it is ſweetly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent honour to ſerve the immortall God; it is more then a weighty thing to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him, and to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about his buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>See your calling, ye Rulers and Iudges of the earth; Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent you are, becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſent of the King to puniſh, to protect: but this is not all, you alſo are <gap reason="foreign">

And this is your greateſt honour, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in this, that God hath put your worke into your hands: you are not onely the King's, but God's Iuſtices; in this glory ride on proſperouſly, and let your right hand teach you vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant things: you are God's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, this is your dignity.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Servus eſt nomen officii:</hi> God's ſervants have much duty required of them: a ſervant is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> one that moveth abſolutely of himſelfe, hee is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not onely the maſters ſervant, but the maſters wholly. Two things then befit a ſervant, <hi>Conſulere Dominum,</hi> and <hi>Obedire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To receive inſtructions from his maſter in his actions: <hi>The eyes of ſervants looke unto the hand of their Maſters, and the eyes of a Mayden unto the</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:173668:12"/> 
               <hi>hands of her Mistreſſe, Pſalm.</hi> 123. 2. What is this looking to their hands, but waiting for their command by which they muſt be guided? It is a brave thing when ſervants know their bounds, and preſume not above their Maſters pleaſure: things then goe right when the hands take counſel of the head; ſervants goe, when their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſay, goe; come, when their Maſters ſay, come; doe, when their Maſter ſaith, doe it. It is ſo in every houſhold, it is ſo in the great houſhold of God: the Common-wealth, it then flouriſheth when they whom God hath ſet over it, looke what he will have done, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe themſelves to doe that. It is reported of <hi>Scipio Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gel. ſit. 7. c. 1</note> that hee was wont before day to goe into the Capitoll <hi>in Collam Iovis,</hi> and there to ſtay a great while, <hi>quaſs conſultans de Republic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Heathen man did thus by the light of nature, let grace teach the Chriſtian Ruler the ſame courſe, that he enquire at the Law of God for his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <p>2. He muſt obey inſtructions received; doing is the life of having; therefore doth he aske his Maſters advice, that what his Maſter will have done, may be effected. Hee is a bad ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that conſulteth with his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:173668:13"/> Maſter for faſhion, but will doe what he liſt himſelfe: and a bad Magiſtrate is he, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Temple of God to heare what is the Word that commeth from the Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves for al that to let his heart runne after covetouſneſſe, and practiſe injuſtice, either for money or favour to pervert the wayes of righteouſneſſe, which God, who hath given him his chiefe Commiſſion, chalketh out unto him. Iudges ought to remember that they are the ſervants of God, and as they know his will concerning their government, ſo they muſt take heed and doe it, 2 <hi>Chron. 19. 7</hi> this is mans reference unto God, <hi>ſervant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The qualities of this ſervant follow, <hi>bone &amp; fidelis,</hi> good and faithfull: the one whereof, that is, goodneſſe, belongeth to him <hi>qua homo,</hi> as a man; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is, fidelity, <hi>qua ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi>

I anſwer, there is a two-fold goodneſſe, Originall, in God alone; by participation, this in many; God giveth us leave to kindle our candles at his light, as all naturall things

            <p>I obſerve this point the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe I know the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of obtaining a thing, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth men moſt commonly from proſecuting it: becauſe men cannot be every way good, and exactly faithfull as they ſhould, but when they endevour the moſt, then faile in many things, they therefore ſet all at ſix and ſevens, and care not to be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and unfaithfull: but let no man thinke ſo, <hi>Honeſtum est ei</hi>

The Church, <hi>Cant. 1. 4.</hi> complaines that ſhe is blacke and ſunne-burnt, but Chriſt her husband thinkes not ſo; <hi>Thou art all faire, my love, and there is no ſpot in thee, Cant. 4. 7.</hi> As therefore <hi>David</hi> ſpake to his ſonne <hi>Salomon</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that great taske of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the houſe of God, 1 <hi>Chro. 22. 16.</hi> ſo may I ſpeake to all whoſe charge and worke is great and full of difficulties, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and be doing, and the Lord will be with you:</hi> Hee will bee with you in enabling you to his ſervice: hee will bee with you in burying your infirmities, not ſeeing what is blacke and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in your actions, but what white and lovely, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it, <hi>fidelis fuiſti,</hi> thou

            <p>This ſervant had the largeſt portion given him as the eldeſt ſonne of his father, the greateſt regiment committed to his truſt, as the chiefeſt ſervant of his Maſter, yet the <hi>cenſus,</hi> the value of all theſe, of theſe five talents, it is but <hi>pauca,</hi> a few things. So that there is no man in the world lord of many things: The Kings of the earth indeed are like <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> tree, <hi>Dan. 4. 20.</hi> their height reacheth toheaven, their ſight to al the earth, their leaves are faire, their fruit is much, the God of heaven hath given them power, and ſtrength, and glory, ſo that if they be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with meane men, they ſeeme infinitely to differ from them, and to bee gods in the

For, 1 the earth, over which they command, is but <hi>punctum,</hi> a point of the world; and can you looke for many things in a point? it goeth into a little cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the heart of <hi>Alexander</hi> could hold many earths, and can there be many things in a little roome?

            <p>I ſpeake not this to detract from either Soveraigne or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate authority, God forbid; they are as the Sunne and Stars, which in their ſeverall kindes doe ſuſtaine the earth by their heats and influences; many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, much honour belongs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:173668:23"/> unto them, let them with all comfort enjoy them: Onely this they muſt know, that theſe things which appeare ſo great and ſo many to men looking with the ſpectacles of bodily eyes, to a ſoule fraught full of love, and reſpect to an infinite God, are ſmall, are few, are nothing, therefore ought not to puffe them up with pride and arrogancy, to turne them from him who is the incommutable good, but ſo muſt they uſe them as not poſſeſſing them, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, they may alſo have God with them.</p>
            <p>How little then remaines to them who have but one Talent? It is, God wot, a poore pittance, yet is there that ſelfe-love in many men, that they thinke their mole-hill a mountaine, their Keſtrill an Eagle, their Gooſe a Swanne. It is a ſtrange thing to ſee that the very attoms of the Countrey, who are but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:173668:23"/> at the ut moſt borders of theſe few things, doe yet ſet an high price upon their meane wares. If a man get but a little money, ſome houſe and land, a ſmall command in a poore village, hee preſently thinkes himſelfe to bee more than ſome body, boaſts of many things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnes his equals, oppreſſeth his poore neighbours, growes ſtubborne, obſtinate and wilful, will doe what hee liſt, as if hee were lord of the world: Why? the lords of the world ſhould not doe ſo; God here cals them rulers in a few things, that they may know, meekneſſe, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, gentleneſſe ought to dwell with them; much leſſe ſhould the thiſtles of Lebanon advance themſelves for a matter of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and be ſo luſty.</p>
            <p>Well it were that every man would well view the latitude of that ſtation wherein God hath ſet him; conſider the largeneſſe

            <p>It is ſo in generall, the feare of God makes all men doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and it is ſo in the matter we have in hand; the feare of God maketh a Magiſtrate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and therefore this feare is eſpecially required in him. <hi>Iethro's</hi> Iuſtice muſt bee a man fearing God, <hi>Exod. 18. 21.</hi> And
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:173668:58"/> the firſt part of <hi>Iehoſhaphat's</hi> charge to his Iudges aymes at this, <hi>Let the feare of God bee upon you, 2 Chron. 19. 7.</hi> and there is great reaſon, that a Magiſtrate above others ſhould bee a man fearing God,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his place; authority, and power puffe men up, make them thinke they may doe what they liſt; it is a hard thing in nature for a man to be great and good; ſome who have done worthily while they have been commanded, have forgot their goodneſſe when they became commanders. The Hiſtorian obſerves, that among all the <note place="margin">Tac. hiſt. l. 1. c 13</note> Roman Emperors, <hi>ſolus Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus in melius mutatus eſt,</hi> only <hi>Vespaſian</hi> grew the better for his dignity: And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon proverbe is, <hi>Honores mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant mores,</hi> Men are lightly worſe after honours, than they were before. So prone are all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:173668:58"/> men through their corruption, when they are exalted, to bee like the unjuſt Iudge, <hi>Luk. 18. 1.</hi> who neither cared for God nor man. Thus it alwayes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth where men give way to their owne unruly affections, but where the feare of God is planted, there the greater men are, the better; their greatneſſe giues them hands to bee able, and Gods fe are an heart to bee willing to do much good. There is nothing worſe than a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate without the feare of God, armed injuſtice is the worſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: and nothing better then a Magiſtrate fearing God, armed Iuſtice is moſt Soveraigne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard of the many provecations they are ſubject unto. He that is in place of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſhall bee beleagred by kindred, by friends, by ſervants, by mony, ſuit upon ſuit, reward upon reward, to turne his heart out of the way, and his tongue

I may well ſay to Governours, as <hi>Simeon</hi> the Propheticall Monke ſpake to the Pillars which hee whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped before the Earth-quake, Stand faſt, for you ſhall be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hall,</hi> in <hi>que v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But let Iew and Gentile be as incredulous as they will, the Scriptures teſtifie, and we muſt beleeve that Chriſt is riſen: What though all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide make this ſigne of Chriſts Divinity, his Reſurrection, as a thing worthy to be ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, yet <hi>amplectatur et gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat Chriſtianus,</hi> the Chriſtian muſt embrace it with joy, and joyfully acknowledge that Chriſt is riſen.

               <hi>ſtatum;</hi> the thing raiſed, the vertue raiſing it, the eſtate of it being riſen.</p>
            <p>1. The thing raiſed was his body, which alone catched the fall, and was layd low in the duſt; yet doe we referre this reſurrection to the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon when wee ſay, Chriſt is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; becauſe the ſoule was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned tothe body, whoſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, hard entreaties e're-while made itleave; and the Deity, (though in <hi>abſtracto,</hi> in it ſelfe uncapable of either falling or riſing, yet in <hi>concreto,</hi> in his perſon, becauſe of that unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able union with the manhood and communication of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) having riſing truly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto it. Chriſt then roſe, but <hi>ſecundum humanam natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> in his Humanity, and his Humanity properly, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in the body; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtand up from the dead, was met by that glorious ſoule
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:173668:71"/> which for a time had departed from it. Chriſt, he was not (as once his Diſciples ſwallowed up with feare miſtooke him, and other ſince blaſphemouſly have ſaid in earneſt) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſpirit, a ſhadow, a man of Ayre; but he had a reall, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall, humane body like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ours; which as hee walked with all his life time, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with him to the Croſſe at his death, and left it after death to be buried by his loving Diſciples, ſo brought hee the ſame againe from the depth of the grave, not changed in kinde, but the very ſame; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me, for it is I, even I my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Luke 24. 39.</hi> Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated his body to bee the ſame by certaine degrees, one proofe being more ſtrong than another: 1. In that it had <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram corporis effigiem,</hi> a bodies ſhape and proportion, therefore hee bid deth his Apoſtles behold
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:173668:71"/> and ſee him; but ſo, <hi>ſpectra,</hi> ſpirits, as they call them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in humane forme. 2. In that it was <hi>ſolidum,</hi> a faſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid body, not thinne and ſubtill, therefore he biddeth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples handle him; but this, though it prove a body, yet not the ſame. 3. Therefore, to take away al doubt, and to ſhew indeed it was the ſame, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for <hi>Thomas,</hi> who now might ſee his hands, and touch his ſide; his hands bored with the nayles, his ſide pierced with the Souldiers Speare; and then (as faithleſſe as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) he became faithfull with the aſſurance of faith, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> Here then wee have to conſider of theſe three things: 1. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chriſts humane nature, that the ſame body which hee brought from the wombe of the Virgin at his firſt being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, the ſame hee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:173668:72"/> brought againe from the womb of the earth, when hee opened it the ſecond time, to tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; a maine pillar of our comfort, that Chriſt tooke our fleſh; for, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, if he tooke not our fleſh, wee are not ſaved by him. 2. Here is the truth of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the eleven incredulous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, the two Travellers to <hi>Emaus, Mary Magdalen,</hi> five hundred brethren at once, a thicke cloud of witneſſes; all theſe ſaw, all theſe teſtifie <hi>(and we know their teſtimony is true)</hi> that the ſame body which was hanged upon the tree, the ſame did God raiſe up the third day, having looſed the ſorrowes of death. 3. Here wee ſee with what bodies we ſhal ariſe at the day of Iudgement, with theſe we have about us, as Chriſt roſe with his: So <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Iob 19. 26. Though after my skinne wormes deſtroy my body, yet</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:173668:72"/> 
               <hi>ſhall J ſee God in my fleſh; whom I my ſelfe ſhall ſee, and mine eyes ſhall behold, and none other for me.</hi> And this is the thing raiſed.</p>
            <p>But what great matter, will the Atheiſt ſay, is this, that Chriſt roſe againe? Have not others riſen, which have beene longer dead than he? It is true, they have; but marke the vertue Raiſing, and you ſhall finde <hi>novum ſuper terram,</hi> a thing never heard of upon earth before; they were raiſed, Chriſt raiſed himſelfe. <hi>Lazarus</hi> muſt have the lowd call of Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 11. 43.</hi> or elſe had hee ſlept his long ſleepe: <hi>Elizeus</hi> with the touch of his bones ſet a man upon his feet, who was caſt dead into his Sepulcher, 2 <hi>King. 13. 21.</hi> yet long and long may <hi>Elizeus</hi> lye in the grave himſelfe, waiting to bee raiſed by another, becauſe hee cannot raiſe himſelfe. Hence
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:173668:73"/> came Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> diſtinction, <hi>Aliorum reſurrectiones, vel ſuſcitationes potius;</hi> they had externall force rayſing them, Chriſt alone internall; as hee ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>I have power to lay downe my life, and I have power to take it againe, Joh. 16. 18.</hi> But what then meant <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to ſay, <hi>God raiſed up Ieſus, Acts 2. 32.</hi> and <hi>Paul, Chriſt was raiſed from death by the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Father, Rom 6. 3.</hi> The anſwer is plaine, that Chriſt may be conſidered two wayes: 1. <hi>Ratione unitae Deitatis,</hi> as he was God as well as man; and ſo wee may ſay, his body reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſoule which before it loſt; and the ſoule came againe to the body which before it left; the Divinity of Chriſt (which never left the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but was united unto it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,) working this wonderfull conjunction. 2. <hi>Ratione natura create,</hi> he may
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:173668:73"/> bee conſidered in his paſſible humane nature which was ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and this had not that great power in it ſelfe, but was raiſed by the God-head both of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; himſelf; for <hi>opera Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis ad extra ſunt indiviſa;</hi> in theſe outward actions, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Trinity concurre joyntly, ſo that when God the Father raiſeth, the Sonne ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth alſo; and therefore might truly ſay of the Temple of his body, <hi>In three dayes I will raiſe it up againe, Ioh. 2. 19.</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did Chriſt plainly ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be God, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 1. 4.</hi> for, <hi>ſuper as evadere ad auras hic labor, hoe opus eſt,</hi> It paſſeth the bounds of all humane ſtrength to unwind it ſelfe out of the ſnares of death. Let then the accurſed <hi>Arrian</hi> call into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the God-head of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; let him imagine this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to proceed from the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:173668:74"/> of the Deity preſent with him, not from the verity thereof in him; but let us, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the rule and light of Scripture, acknowledge the bright beames of his Divinity, amidſt the moſt dusky clouds of his Humanity; confeſſing him to be God, one with the Father, and co-equall: as upon other grounds, ſo among the reſt upon this, That once he was dead, but is now alive; once he was buried, but the third day riſen. This is the ſecond thing, the power whereby Chriſt was rayſed.</p>
            <p>The third is his ſtate being riſen, and this was a ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; hee had privilege from future death; hee dyed indeed, but it was but once; <hi>Being rayſed from the dead, hee dyeth no more; death hath no more power over him, Rom 6. 9</hi> Others being raiſed, muſt paſſe the ſecond time the ſtreights
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:173668:74"/> of death, the anxiety whereof being once acquainted with, it muſt ſurely bee great horror to thinke that once againe they muſt goe through them; but Chriſt having once made ſpoile of that All-ruling Tyrant, hath ſo over-maſtered him, that he durſt never ſince ſet upon him. Therefore is it the Motto of the Sonne of man, <hi>I am alive, and I live for evermore, Rev. 1. 18.</hi> Others riſing was in this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that being actually freed from death, and ranſomed from his captivity, yet are they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject every houre to become his thralls, and to be catched in his ginnes: but Chriſts riſing was perfect, in that hee was freed, <hi>non a morte ſolum, ſed a neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate et poſsibilitate moriendi;</hi> not alone from the actuality of death (from which many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) but from the power of ever being againe a priſoner to him.

            <p>1. Chriſt is the cauſe of our riſing by way of example, in his Reſurrection ſhewing us two things for our imitation: 1. what muſt bee the end and ſcope of our whole converſation; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that wee may attaine the glory of the life to come: and of this, <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaketh in his Morals; There are, ſaith he, two wayes of all men in the body; one before death, the other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reſurrection; in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer all men walked, wholly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the latter, till Chriſt came in the fleſh, and by ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one himſelfe, pointed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:173668:78"/> us the other: by dying, he led the life we enjoy; by riſing againe, opened the way which we are to ſeeke; teaching us by his example, that this life is not to be loved for it ſelfe, but to be tolerated for a better. 2. By what meanes wee muſt attaine this end; that is by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life, and pious carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and this patterne Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> telleth us of, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectione Domini configuratur vita quae hic geritur,</hi> Chriſts ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing faſhions the whole courſe of the life wee live here; and therefore ſaid the Apoſtle, we are ingrafted into the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Chriſts reſurrection that like as he was raiſed from death by the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo we alſo ſhould walk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> upon the top of an hill, his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are our inſtructions, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given us an enſample that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:173668:78"/> we ſhould follow his ſteppes: Now his actions they were of two ſorts: ſome <hi>morales,</hi> which reſpected the fulfilling of the Law, ſuch as were his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, meekneſſe, innocency, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to parents, magiſtrates, and the like: Others <hi>mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> ſuch as reſpected his office of Mediatorſhip, as yeelding himſelfe to death, riſing againe from the dead; in both theſe is he a patterne unto us, though not after the ſame manner: In the former wee are to imitate him in the ſame kinde, doing what he did, though wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe it in the ſame degree; therefore he the great Maſter, calleth to all his Schollers to learne of him, that he is humble and lowly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> willeth us, when we are reviled, not to revile again; when we ſuffer, not to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, becauſe Chriſt himſelfe alſo did ſo, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23. In
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:173668:79"/> the latter we are to imitate him by ſimilitude; tranſlating that unto our ſpirituall life, which he did as Mediator; thus his dying teacheth us not to die the death of the body, but of ſinne; to crucifie the fleſh, with the affections and luſts thereof: and his riſing againe teacheth us, not to come out of the graves when we are buried (alas, it paſſeth the ſtrength of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity) but to ariſe from ſinne, the death of the ſoule. Behold then, apiſh man, who art ready to follow every faſhion, a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne worthy the looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, an example worthy the following, even thy Saviour riſing! Oh be thou a Saint, and riſe with him! Dye he might, but could not be overcome of death, and therefore looſed the ſorrowes of it: So, howſoever thou haſt ſinned, yet bee not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled by ſinne, ſuffer it not to reigne in thy mortall body.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:173668:79"/> Voluntarily went hee once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the darke bowels of the earth, and there remained three dayes; neceſſarily through the corruption of thy nature, and voluntarily alſo through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of thy will, haſt thou fallen into the depths of ſinne, and there haſt laid three daies; the day of thy conception, for thou wert ſhapen in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: the day of thy birth, for thou wert polluted in thine owne blood: the day of thy life hitherto, for thou haſt beene a ſtranger from the womb, from the wombe haſt thou erred: as therefore thy death of ſinne hath beene like unto Chriſts being in the grave, ſo let thy riſing from ſinne bee comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the ſimilitude of his Reſurrection: now the third day breake forth into the light, throw away thy grave-clothes, the workes of darkeneſſe, and put on the apparell of a man,

It was that, they ſay, which made <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> ſouldiers ſo willing to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt deſperate matters, that what he would have them doe, himſelfe firſt beganne; and therefore was wont to ſay, <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, faciamus;</hi> what you ſee mee doe, doe you the ſame likewiſe.

To teach a cripple how to goe, or a dumbe man how to ſpeake, is a fruitleſſe thing; but to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the feet and ankle-bones of the one, to untye the ſtrings of the others tongue, this is the way to make them goe and ſpeake: So fareth it with us all (my beloved) wee were like that man poſſeſſed with Divels, who abode among the graves; ſinne had ſo wounded us, that we were cut off from the land of the living, being dead in treſpaſſes, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 1. what could it then have benefited us, if one
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:173668:81"/> whoſe life was within him ſhould walke and ſtirre? that Chriſt who was quickened by the Spirit, could come out of the grave? ſurely nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, had alſo quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our benummed ſoules then and not otherwiſe could wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe: it was therefore requiſite that to his example ſet before us, Chriſt ſhould adde the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of vertue to us, that we might riſe with him. And this is that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 2. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God hath quickned us together with Chriſt; giving him the Spirit of life, whereby he was raiſed from the dead, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to us the life of the Spirit, that we might riſe from ſinne: And this is that <hi>medicinalis convenientia</hi> of Saint <hi>Auſtins,</hi> wherby the Example of Chriſts riſing is made effectuall; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:173668:81"/> the applying of medicines to out infirmities, purging out all humours whereby we might be ſtayed in our corruptions; and ſtrengthening the vitall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties for the exerciſe of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things; for as Chriſt dyed to take away from ſinne the guilt, the puniſhment, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which it got over man, ſo that man might be ſaid to be dead to ſinne, becauſe hee no longer lived therein; ſo did he riſe againe to furniſh man with all gifts and graces neceſſary for his ſoules ſalvation: and every faithfull man is partaker, as of Mortification by vertue of Chriſts death, ſo of Vivificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by vertue of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For fuller perceiving wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we muſt know, that Chriſt is as the head, his Saints the members; Chriſt the root, his Saints the branches; as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the motion of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and governing them in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:173668:82"/> their actions proceedeth from the head, where is the motive faculty in greateſt vigour; ſo doe the members of Chriſt his myſticall body derive from him the influence of grace, whereby they are enabled to performe their functions, <hi>de plenitudine eius, Ioh.</hi> 1. 16. from him we draw, of him we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Now Chriſt is the head of his Church as Mediator, and by his workes of Mediation moſt of all diffuſeth life and motion, and that ſweetly in an analogy to the worke; ſo his death giveth a motion to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the corrupting of the old man; and his Reſurrection, a motion to quickening, the quickening of the new man; theſe two, like maine channels, convey whole ſtreames of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from him into the Church: neither doth the diſproportion of ſoule and body hinder this conveyance at all, Chriſt riſing

            <p>And are they riſen together with him?

Doſt thou beleeve that thou art riſen with Chriſt? Thou muſt ſo beleeve, if thou beleeveſt the Scriptures: I demand then, Who ſeparated thee? And what haſt thou, that thou haſt not received? And if thou haſt received it, why boaſteſt thou as if thou hadſt not received it? 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. Boaſt not then thy

            <p>Surely our riſing hath great ſimilitude and likeneſſe with Chriſts riſing: Now in Chriſts riſing we may eſpecially ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve three things: 1. <hi>Corporis</hi>

The rayſing of the ſoule from ſinne, which is the very duſt and death ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. 2. The uniting of it to God, who is <hi>anima animae,</hi> the very life and ſoule of the ſoule, in whom it liveth, moveth, and hath it being, not in nature only, but alſo in grace. 3. The knitting of theſe two, God and the ſoule together in the perfect bands of love, which may not be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every little jarre broken, but remaine inviolably for ever firme and ſure. 1. Wee muſt

So let mee ſound this ſpeech in the eare of the ſinner covered over with the moulds of ſinne, What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou there, thou ſinner?

This is done by repentance, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſinne, breaking off ſin, leaving ſinne, which is the firſt degree of our riſing, the firſt ſtep to life. 2.

            <p>To conclude then this point, Let all of us who profeſſe our ſelves Chriſtians, and triumph in our Saviours reſurrection, let all of us, I ſay, riſe with him; as well he that hath beene dead but an houre or two, hee that

Let not the young man lye ſtill, and thinke another day will come, and then it will be time enough for him to riſe; but as Chriſt roſe early in the morning, ſo let him riſe in the prime &amp; morning of his youth; if he find the grave now open, and his ſoule to be in him, let him take heed leſt the grave ſhut her mouth againe upon him, leſt his ſoule being taken againe out of that drowſie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he have no more ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to riſe: Againe, let not the old man lye ſtill and not ariſe, becauſe hee feareth hee hath laid too long, and there is no hope for him to recover life for ſweet and comfortable is that ſaying of Saint <hi>Auſtine, V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Well are we who have ſhaked off this bondage, and are free to come to Chriſt, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath appointed, with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty repentance, earneſt faith, willing affections, ſo to <hi>ſeeke the things that are above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By things above may be meant heavenly things, the happineſſe which aboundeth in heaven, and which we are by God ordained unto; and then <hi>ſeeking</hi> ſignifieth two things: 1. A deſire of this happineſſe: 2. The uſing of the meanes to attaine this happineſſe. 1. They which are riſen, deſire things above; not with a lazy wiſh, <hi>oh that ſome would give mee to drinke of the waters of life!</hi> but with ardor and fervency, ſuch as was in <hi>David, Pſal. 42. 1. Like as the Hart panteth after the water brookes, ſo longeth my ſoule after thee O God: my</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:173668:90"/> 
               <hi>ſoule is athirſt for God, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the living God: oh when ſhall I come and appeare in the preſence of God?</hi> 2. They uſe the meanes of attaining it; no way ſo ſtraight that they will not walke in, if it lead to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; no labour ſo hard which they will not endure, if it end in happineſſe; fire, water, ſwords, ſtones, they will paſſe through them all to this weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy place: Thus doe the Saints, <hi>Aſcenſiones disponere in corde,</hi> thinke of nothing but aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upward: they digge not downe to hell, to fetch from thence wicked plots and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; they ſpend not themſelves upon the earth to get riches, honours, and preferments, but <hi>ſurſum corda,</hi> all their delight is above theſe tranſitory things, their ſoules are heaven-wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſpirits, raviſhed with the joy they know to be there, and therefore attend ever to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:173668:91"/> of it.

What mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth then the high-climbing ambition of haughty ſpirits to places of promotion and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? What meaneth the hoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up of treaſures by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous; the ſwimming in laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious pleaſures by the voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous?

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:173668:91"/> that wee are worldly; and if worldly, how heavenly? Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, our love of earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with the love of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; our ſeeking of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, with ſeeking things above. If then we would have comfort in our owne ſoules, that we are riſen with Chriſt, let us aſeend with him, from licking the baſe duſt with the curſed creatures, to feed of celeſtiall Manna; that though our bodies tread upon the earth yet our converſation maybe in heaven, from whence we looke for our Saviour, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to come; who at his comming, as he hath ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our ſoules already to the life of grace, will rayſe our bodies to the life of glory, and make them like his owne moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body.</p>

When thou didſt theſe things, I kept ſilence.</hi> So God himſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50 21. The ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:173668:93"/> of vengeance cauſeth the overflow of ſinne; becauſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is not executed, the harts of men are ſet to doe miſchiefe; becauſe God keepes ſilence, the ſinner thinkes hee is haile fellow with him. And the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow of ſinne, cauſeth the awaking of vengeance: <hi>The ſinner ſhall not prolong his dayes, though without controule hee doth evill an hundred times,</hi> the ſame Preacher telleth us: <hi>I will reprove thee, and ſet thy ſins in order,</hi> the ſame God ſpeakes it. So that in few words I have pointed out to you foure things: Mans ſinne: Gods connivence upon his ſinne: Mans blodneſſe upon his connivence: Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon mans boldneſſe.</p>
            <p>Will you ſee all theſe verefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an example? You need go no further than <hi>Iehu,</hi> whom my Text nameth; looke his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, 2 <hi>King. 9, 10, chap.</hi> and compare it with theſe words,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:173668:93"/> you ſhall find them all plainely laid before you. 1. He kills his Maſter, <hi>leboram,</hi> the King, <hi>chap. 9. verſ.</hi> 24. there is his ſinne; how farre he ſinned in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you ſhal heare afterward. 2. There neither comes thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt from heaven to ſtrike him, neither doth the earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen her mouth to devoure him, nor any other plague ſeize upon him for it; there is Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence. 3. Hereupon he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth to daſh <hi>lezabel,</hi> the Queene, againſt the walls, to behead the kings children, to cut off from <hi>Ahab</hi> all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, <hi>chap</hi> 10. there is his boldneſſe. Hitherto all ſorts well with him, the world goeth on his ſide ſtill: but you looke for a fourth part, what God prepared for him all this while; my Text wil tel you that, which is nothing elſe, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of vengeance againſt <hi>Iehu's</hi> houſe for this bloody cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:173668:94"/> Heare the words, and you ſhal underſtand his puniſhment; <hi>I will avenge the blood of Iez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel upon the houſe of Iehu.</hi> You have the ſcope and the ſumme.</p>
            <p>The parts are three: <hi>Paena, Crimen, Reus:</hi> A puniſhment denounced, <hi>I will avenge:</hi> A fault to be puniſhed, <hi>The blood of Iezreel:</hi> A part to ſuſtaine the puniſhment, <hi>The houſe of Iehu</hi> Each part ſubdivideth it ſelfe into two branches. In the puniſhment you have two things: 1. The foreſhewing of an evill to come: The tenſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foordeth this conſideration <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the future ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>I will avenge.</hi> 2. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the evill foreſhowne, this the Verbe telleth us, it is avenging. In the crime you have likewiſe two things: 1. The fault in generall to bee puniſhed, that is, murder; ſet downe here under the name of blood. 2. The reſtriction of this
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:173668:94"/> fault in reſpect of the perſons murthered, in the word Iezreel, <hi>the blood of Iezreel.</hi> Finally, in the party ſuſtaining, you have two things; the root and the branches, the fountaine and the rivers, <hi>Iehu</hi> and his poſterity. <hi>the houſe of Iehu.</hi> So that theſe words doe give us to conſider of fix things: 1. Gods predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of evill to come: 2. Gods puniſhing of evill men: 3. His puniſhing of murther: 4. His puniſhing the murther done in Iezreel: 5. His avenging it upon <hi>Iehu:</hi> 6. His avenging it upon his houſe. Of theſe briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will avenge,)</hi> this is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> prediction. It is obſerved in earthly policy among Princes, that upon any offence offered by their neighbours, they doe not preſently ſet upon them with fire and ſword, untill they have ſent an Herauld to declare their grievance, and denounce
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:173668:95"/> warre: God commanded it to the Iſraelites, <hi>Deut</hi> 20. 10. and the law of nature, as it ſeemeth, diſperſed it to all Nations: The manner thereof among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans is deſcribed by <hi>Gellius;</hi>

            <p>For the firſt: It is directly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> expreſſed by the Prophet <hi>Amos, chap. 4. 12. Thus will I doe unto thee, O Iſrael; and becauſe I will doe thus unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael</hi> The comminations of God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doe not ſhut up the way to repentance but rather open it, inviting the ſinner to ſend up his humility, his penitence, his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:173668:96"/> prayers, to ſtand in the gappe, and to keepe off the wrath of God, that it come not foorth to conſume him. <hi>If I ſpeake,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>againſt a Nation to plucke it up and deſtroy it, if that Nation, againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evill way, I will repent of the evill which I thought to do unto them, Ier.</hi> 18. 7.

I will in <hi>hypotheſi</hi> ſhew this to have beene the fault of <hi>Iehu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt: the truth of the ground will appeare to us if we conſider two things; the rule of mans doing, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his doing, which two have maine ſway in making all his actions good or bad: if man
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:173668:112"/> have both a good rule to direct him what is to be done, and a good principle from whence hee ſendeth forth his actions, certainely the thing done muſt needs be good; but if hee be defective in either of theſe, his worke is evill: to doe a good thing not well, that is naught; and to doe with a good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an evill thing, that is naught likewiſe. Now then here is in the ground laid downe, the command of God, a good rule; he that doth that, cannot miſſe of the right; but where is <hi>principium operandi,</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple out of which man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth? Surely, that is oft-times two-faced with <hi>Ianus,</hi> confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the command, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing commanded, but <note place="margin">Aq. 2. 2. q. 104. a. 2. 3.</note> yet hath <hi>aliquid de ſuo,</hi> ſome <hi>proprium volitum</hi> of his owne, never commanded, whereby it becommeth diſobedient: Man doth oftentimes what
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:173668:113"/> God commandeth him, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee commandeth it, but for the ſatisfying of his owne humour and ſo, though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be the Inſtrument of Gods will, yet is he alſo the cauſe of his owne puniſhment; becauſe many things are good <hi>quatenus,</hi> and <hi>quouſ<expan>

            <p>Now man ſevereth Gods command from his will, two wayes: 1. In his diſpoſition to the action. when he ſtandeth not ſo affected in doing Gods command, as God would have him doe. 2. In his diſpoſition to the end of the action, when God aymeth at one thing, he at another.</p>

            <p>That is, the poſterity of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> thoſe that were of his line, and proceeded from him.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:173668:120"/> fit upon his Throne. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe God made good, but would not enlarge it any further: Within a ſhort time after this Prophecy, the fourth man of his ſeed, being King, was ſlaine by a Traytor, who uſurped the kingdome into his owne hands; this was the end of <hi>Iehu</hi>'s houſe, the cauſe of which end is here in the Text attributed to the blood of Iezreel: As <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> had a reward for his worke done, that foure of his ſonnes ſhould reigne; ſo had hee alſo a puniſhment for the bad doing of it, that his children ſhould no longer ſway the Scepter: thus doth God viſit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, as himſelfe ſpeaketh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 4. and payeth home the ſinnes of the predeceſſors, into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of their ſucceſſors, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32 18. The blood of Iezreel ſhed by <hi>Iehu,</hi> came with a full courſe upon <hi>Zachariah</hi> his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childs
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:173668:120"/> grand-childe.</p>
            <p>A ſtrange thing, a man would thinke, and ſcarce to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in Gods juſt adminiſtration of all things, that a man ſhould <note place="margin">Gryniſt. hiſt. 307 p.</note> after many yeeres be puniſhed for that ſinne which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it may be, before the birth of his great grandfather. It was counted a cruell tricke in the great <hi>Cham</hi> of Tartary, that when hee condemned any of his ſubjects to death, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment extended to all his iſſue male; but how much more cruell may this ſeeme here in the Text, that the offenders ſcape unpuniſhed, and hee that is not yet in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> to have the leaſt participation of the offence, ſhould after the fourth generation abide the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of it? But ſtop thy mouth whoſoever intendeſt to diſpute with God, his judgements are often ſecret, but alwayes juſt; if he have done it, that is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:173668:121"/> enough for thee to free it from injuſtice: And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe fleſh and blood loves to be prying into the Arke, to finde out the wayes of God, and the reaſon of his doings, he hath vouchſafed in Scripture to open his Iuſtice, and to cleare himſelfe from fond mens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations. For the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then of this courſe of Gods judgements, wee are to know theſe two things: 1. That God puniſheth no man who is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply innocent, and deſerveth not puniſhment. 2. That it is in his power to puniſh the nocent in what kind he himſelfe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, or to ſpare him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He puniſheth none who is ſimply innocent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtly findeth fault with that proverb taken up in Iſrael, <hi>Ezek 18. 2. The fathers have eaten ſowre grapes, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens teeth are ſet on edge;</hi> whereby the Iſraelites com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:173668:121"/> that whereas they were all holy, and no ſpot in them, yet did they beare the tranſgreſſions of their fathers: that whole Chapter hath God affirming, <hi>that he which ſinneth not, ſhall ſurely live.</hi> It is true that God viſiteth the iniquities of the fathers upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but they are <hi>filii qui ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi> ſuch as partake in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſinnes; for otherwiſe the ſonne ſhal not beare the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the father, God will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him from the puniſhment of ſinne, if hee be no way party in it: When therefore the <note place="margin">Par. ani. in Bell. de a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſ. quae. l. 4. c. 8</note> Iewes did beare the burthen of their fathers faults, it was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident ſigne that they were themſelves a rebellious ſeed, ſuch as ſtood up in their fathers ſtead; as heires of their land, ſo of their wickedneſſe. Thus it fared with <hi>Iehu's</hi> houſe, of whom we may read in the book of <hi>Kings,</hi> that they continued
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:173668:122"/> not his blood alone, but his Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry alſo, <hi>Every one of them did evill in the ſight of the Lord, and walked in the ſinnes of Ieroboam who made Iſrael to ſinne; as their father Iehu had done, ſo did they.</hi> This puniſhment was therefore juſt in reſpect of them, they well deſerved it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God may puniſh the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as hee pleaſeth, or ſpare him; for he is the Lord of all, and hath the reines of all things in his hands; who ſhal controule him in exercifing either his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or his Mercy according to his owne mind? So that when the father committeth a fault, and God hath threatned venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt him for it, he may, if he will, let the father paſſe, and take the ſonne who hath ſhare in guilt as well as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had, and no man ſay to him, why doſt thou ſo? There are many reaſons why God paſſeth over the father, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:173668:122"/> there is one reaſon why he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the children.</p>
            <p>The reaſons why he paſſeth over the father as I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, are foure:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometime the feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment hath humbled him, and moved him to repentance; this effect the ſpeech of <hi>Elias</hi> had with <hi>Ahab,</hi> which was the cauſe that God brought not evill upon his houſe in his daies, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 21. 29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometime the father hath ſome good things, in regard whereof, God will forbeare to lay heavy temporall judgments upon him; thus did <hi>Ieroboams</hi> ſonne come to the grave in peace, becauſe there was found ſome good in him toward the God of Iſrael, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sometime God will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the faithfulneſſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed ſervant, by ſparing his ſonne after him; ſo dealt hee with <hi>Solomon, Thou ſhalt bee</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:173668:123"/> 
               <hi>Prince all the dayes of thy life, for my ſervant Davids ſake, 1 King.</hi> 11. 33.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sometime God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed temporall proſperity to a man, in regard of ſome good ſervice done by him: ſo God ſuffered <hi>Iehu</hi> to hold the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for his time, to make good his promiſe wherewith formerly hee had bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto him: for theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes God oft-times freeth the father that ſinneth, from ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>

But why is it then ſayd, God puniſheth the ſinne of the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:173668:123"/> fathers upon the children, and not the ſinnes of the children in themſelves? In my opinion, if ever <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpake rightly, he doth it in this point; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſaith he, are puniſhed for their fathers, not becauſe their owne ſinnes doe not deſerve puniſhment, but becauſe <hi>Niſi praeceſſiſſent peccata parentum,</hi>

               <hi>Deus eos fortaſſe non puniret in hoc mundo;</hi> God maketh the fathers ſinne an occaſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting that judgement upon the child, which elſe peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hee would not have layd upon him: Theſe things being conſidered, it will appeare, hat God is juſt in puniſhing the blood of Iezreel upon the houſe of <hi>Iehu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude all, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this point may teach us two things: 1. It juſtifieth <note place="margin">Lit. Aug.</note> our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iturgy in that prayer, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not, Lord, the offences of our fore-fathers;</hi> which,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:173668:124"/> though ſome miſlike, I know not upon what grounds, yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to mee a fit prayer for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian: for if God hath threatned that hee will avenge the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and hath frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done ſo, why may wee not pray againſt ſuch an evill?</p>
            <p>2. It teacheth parents to have a care not to diſpleaſe God, if not for their owne ſakes, yet for their deare chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens cauſe, whom they may, by their diſobedience, bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame ſea of miſery into which they fall themſelves: Thou thinkeſt it thy duty to provide for their maintenance, and lay up for them; but take heed that thou filleſt not the treaſures of Gods wrath, which though they miſſe thy head, will fall upon the hairy ſcalpe of thy poſterity: and ſhall not then thy children have cauſe to curſe their father that begat them,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:173668:124"/> their mother that bare them, the time wherein they were conceived, when they ſee themſelves inherit the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Parents. Labour to be of the number of thoſe that love God and keepe his Commandements, that he may ſhew mercy unto thouſands of thy children, that thy ſeed may ſtand faſt in the Covenant, that bleſſing may be upon thee and thine for ever. And ſo I end. God, for his mercy ſake, grant that thoſe few words which we have heard at this time with our outward eares, may take deepe rooting in our hearts, and bring forth in us the fruit of good living, to the glory of his Name, and the amendment of our ſinfull lives, through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour; To whom with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt, three perſons, and one God,

The Party, it is a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; it ſo falling out by the Providence of God, that ſhee ſhould be the firſt among the Samaritans that heard the ſound of the Goſpell, and become an Apoſtle, as it were, to all her neighbours, in ſhewing them the Meſſias; that ſo the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of all ſexes in Chriſt might appeare; and that as Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> hath well obſerved, <hi>Quia</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ho. 25. in Evang.</note> 
               <hi>mulier viro prapinavit mortem, mulier viris annuntiaret ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem;</hi> becauſe a woman at the firſt beganne to man in the cup of death, a woman here ſhould beginne to men in the cup of life. The occaſion of the talke was, this womans denying to give Chriſt water, becauſe hee was a Iew; whereupon he, who was ready to take the leaſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing any ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good, taketh upon him to inſtruct her in that ſhee never
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:173668:126"/> heard before. The diſcourſe that paſſed betweene them, was eſpecially of two things, (for other things are inſerted by the way) and they are, The Water of Life, and The true worſhip of God. The former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. continued to 16. The other beginneth <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. continued to the 27.</p>
            <p>The words of the Text be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the latter part of the Diſcourſe which concerned the Worſhip of God, and they are ſpoken by the woman, who doth in them three things at once: 1. She findeth fault with Chriſt for magnifying Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, as the onely place where God would bee worſhipped: 2. Shee extolleth her fathers worſhip in that mountaine, which was neere unto the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: 3. Shee tacitely uttereth her owne reſolution, that ſhee would continue to worſhip af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of her fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:173668:127"/> for the words are to bee conſidered two wayes, either as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſimple propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, containing in them a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things done, <hi>Her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had worſhipped in that mountaine:</hi> Or as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a Praemiſſe or Antecedent to a Concluſion, which this woman meant to inferre there from; for ſhee hath a further reach in them than a bare affirmation; namely, hence to approve her owne, and her peoples wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that they alſo might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully worſhip in that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as well as their fathers had done.</p>
            <p>So that this ſpeech of the woman is like <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſheepe, <hi>varicolor,</hi> ſpeckled, partly white, partly black; hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing good in it, ſomething bad That which was good in it is two-fold: 1. The matter of her ſpeech, it relates a truth, her fathers worſhipping in the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:173668:127"/> Mountaine: 2. Her uttering it declares that ſhee had an eye to the ſervice of God practiſed in former times. To her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers worſhip: That which was bad is this, That ſhee was too much addicted to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Religion; and reſolved, upon that ground, becauſe her fathers had done ſo, to live and dye in ſo worſhipping, whether ſhee did right or wrong. I will ſpeake of this ſpeech both theſe wayes; that what is good in it, wee may bee provoked to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; what ill in it, wee may be moved to avoyd.</p>
            <p>And firſt of what was good in it, and there in of the matter, <hi>her fathers worſhip in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi> This Mountaine it was <hi>Gerazim,</hi> ſituated neere unto the City of <hi>Sichem, Judg</hi> 9. 7. There the Patriarch <hi>Iacob,</hi> at his returne from <hi>Labans</hi> houſe, built an Altar, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 20. Of this worſhip of <hi>Iacob</hi> is this
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:173668:128"/> ſpeech mainely meant, <hi>Her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worſhipped;</hi> for as the Iewes boaſted of <hi>Abraham</hi> their father, ſo boaſted the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans of <hi>Iacob</hi> their father, as you may ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12 Now the thing here related, <hi>Iacobs worſhip in the mountaine,</hi> may give us to obſerve this point, The worſhip of God was of old wont to bee performed on mountaines, he appointed them eſpecially to bee the places of his Service; as if that were true of God, which the ſervants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Kin 20. 23 Dii eorum Dii montium,</hi> the God of Iſrael is the God of the mountaines. Thus was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> commanded to offer up <hi>Iſaac</hi> to God upon a mountain. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 2. It was Gods charge to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he ſhould come up into the mountaine, <hi>Exod,</hi> 19 20. The Prophets charge to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Aſcende in aream, Goe up unto the threſhing floore of A</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:173668:128"/> 
               <hi>raunah, 2 Sam.</hi> 24. 18. When <hi>Solomon</hi> built that glorious Temple, hee ſet it upon the mountaine of <hi>Moriah, 2 Chron.</hi> 3. 1. Yea, our Saviour himſelfe when hee prayed went into a mountaine, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 12. By this ſerving God in the mountaine, God taught the Iewes, who had all things in types and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and us likewiſe to whom the morall appertaineth, that when wee come to worſhip God, wee muſt lift our ſoules to heavenly cogitations: So the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 10. 22. Draw neere to God with a pure heart:</hi> And <hi>David</hi> of himſelfe, <hi>Pſal. 25. 1. Vnto thee, O Lord, doe I lift up my ſoule.</hi> For as if a man be in the bottome of a deepe pit, he may call lowd to them that walke above, and not bee heard; ſo if our hearts be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in worldly things, we may cry oft enough, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> to God that is in heaven above,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:173668:129" rendition="simple:additions"/> and not be regarded. The old uſe of the Primitive Church is ſtill well retained among us, that the people at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſhould bee admoniſhed by the Paſtor, <hi>ſurſum corda,</hi> lift up your hearts; and they againe ſhould anſwer, as well appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending his ſpeech, <hi>Surſum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus ad Dominum,</hi> wee lift them up unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>For Application of the point; It juſtly condemneth thoſe that come to Church as if they came to Market, and talke with God as with a Chapman, never thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any preparation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in regard of the glory of God; never thinking of any exaltation of the mind, by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly meditation, becauſe wee are on earth, and God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but we come beſmeared with the dregs of filthineſſe, and worldly affaires ſo hanging on, and proſſing us downe, that wee cannot goe into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:173668:129" rendition="simple:additions"/> to meet God, but lye groveling in the vallies, that if God will come to us, ſo it is, we are reſolved not to goe up to him: but let us know (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) that God in this ſenſe may be truly ſayd, not to be the God of the Vallies; hee loveth not to dwell with this earthy and muddy generation, which flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alow the ground, creepe or walke upon it, but cannot take the wings of Devotion, and ſend up their ſoules, as a Bird, to the hills, the hills whence commeth all their helpe: hee loveth to dwell with thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſoules who have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in heaven, and are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed out of themſelves, and choking cares, when they come to worſhip him. I conclude this ſpeech with that of <hi>Iames,</hi> chap. 4. 8. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and hee will draw nigh to you:</hi> How ſhall wee draw nigh to him? <hi>Purge your hearts, you</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:173668:130"/> 
               <hi>ſinners, and clenſe your hands, you double minded men;</hi> come out of the dirt of corruption, into the mountain of holineſſe, as your fathers worſhipped in the Mountaine. Thus much of the matter of the words: I come to the ſecond thing, good in this ſpeech, this womans loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king backe to the Religion pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by her fathers, <hi>Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers worſhipped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein ſhee declares, that ſhee conceived two truths: 1. That the Service of God is ancient; beganne, not in her dayes, but had its Original from the Fathers: 2. That antiquity of Religion is to be reſpected of thoſe that ſeeke out the truth thereof.</p>
            <p>For the firſt: The ſervice of God is ancient; the Angels, who were firſt made, firſt beganne it. <hi>Iob 38. 7. The Starres of the morning prayſed mee together, and all the children of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced:</hi>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:173668:130"/> Men followed in their order; <hi>Abel</hi> offered Sacrifice; <hi>Euoch</hi> walked with God; <hi>Noah</hi> builded an Altar; in <hi>Seths</hi> time men beganne to call on the Name of the Lord: the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ancient times declare, that they before the flood ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted brazen and marble Pillars, wherein they left unto their poſterity the memory of God, and of his providence; and that Religion was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated divers wayes: 1. The Image of God, wherein man was made, conſiſted in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, as one part thereof, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24. Now holineſſe in man, reſpecteth the ſervice of God; and when this Image was decayed by the fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> yet ſo much of it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as carried men to ſome worſhip of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being directed by addition of light from heaven, carried them to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:173668:131"/> the worſhip of the true God. 2. God alwayes had his Church in the world; ſome who were ſheepe of his paſture, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his love, and theſe did worſhip him; for worſhip is the bond that bindeth man to God; without which, man cannot be ſayd to be the ſervant of God, nor God ſayd to be the God of man. 3. God at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt gave precepts of his worſhip. So <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe had a command to abſtain from the tree of the knowledge of good and evill; this abſtinence was his worſhip of God: and why did <hi>Able</hi> bring his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? The Apoſtle ſaith, it was <hi>by faith;</hi> faith reſpecting the promiſe of God in his precept, that by offering ſacrifice hee ſhould ſhew his expectation of that ſeed which was foretold to come into the world.</p>
            <p>So that here every true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper of God at this day hath
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:173668:131"/> a good warrant for his doings, that he followeth the footſteps of all his fathers, the children of God who went before him; and it may be a ſingular comfort to him in his holineſſe, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever men of his owne time wherein hee liveth, bee croſſe unto him, and every man would have his neighbour a Bird of the ſame feather that himſelfe is, yet that he is like to the old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were zealous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, and ſtood in awe of his pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence; that he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with <hi>Seth, Enoch, Ahra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, Iacob,</hi> the holy Prophets, yea, Chriſt himſelfe, and his Apoſtles, who though they lived among Lions, yet did of old ſuſtaine and uphold the ſervice of God in ſpight of all oppoſition: This is it which conjoyneth all the members of the Church together, though living at ſeverall times, that they are united in the worſhip
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:173668:132"/> of God, as many lines in the ſame center. This comforted the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the midſt of his bands, <hi>that after the way which the Iewes called hereſie, he worſhipped the God of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Acts 24. 14.</hi> Hee calleth God, the God of his Fathers, thereby to ſtrengthen himſelfe in his holy courſe againſt the Iewes, who cryed out of him for an hereticke; and ſo ought all true Chriſtians, who ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring with an upright heart to feare God, and keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unſpotted of the world, not ſtained with the iniquity of the times wherein they live, are like to be branded with the title of Noveliſts; they ought to looke upon the wayes of the holy Fathers who lived in times paſt, and ſeeing themſelves walke in their ſteps, and to bee heires of their righteous living, hence to take courage that they goe not in by-pathes where
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:173668:132"/> none went before them, but in the Kings high-way, wherein all the Saints of God walked to heaven; thus the Fathers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God, and thus they worſhip him. This is the firſt thing this woman conceived, the Service of God is ancient.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing was, that the Antiquity of Religion is to be reſpected, and ſo indeed it is. <hi>Deut. 32. 7. Remember the dayes of old, and the yeares of many generations; aske thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he will tell thee; thine elders, and they wil inſtruct thee:</hi> Wee are but of yeſterday, and are ignorant, therefore muſt wee ſearch of our fathers. <hi>Iob</hi> 8. 8. If a man were to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the waies to take his choice, hee could chooſe none better than the old way, wherein wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, he ſhould find reſt unto his ſoule. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 16. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as through the ages of the world there have beene diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:173668:133"/> formes of his Service ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God himſelfe; the one at mans Creation; a ſecond at the Inſtitution of the Church of the Iewes, when the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law was ordained; a third at the founding of the Church of the Chriſtians, when the Doctrine of the Goſpell was ſet forth; they in theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times did right, who kept themſelves to the old forme of worſhipping. Before the Law, they ſerved God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, who tooke patterne from <hi>Abel, Seth, Noah,</hi> the firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that Church Vnder the Law, they ſerved God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, who imitated <hi>Moſes, Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and <hi>Ioſuah</hi> the firſt fathers of that diſpenſation. Since the Law, they ſerve God aright, who follow the ſteps of the bleſſed Apoſtles, and purer times of the diſpenſation of the Goſpell. So that howſoever wee make not Antiquity the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:173668:133" rendition="simple:additions"/> rule of our faith, yet is it a good note of true Religion to agree with the firſt Fathers of the Primitive time: for certainly, that of <hi>Tertullian</hi> is moſt ſound, <hi>Quod antiquiſsimum, illud ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſsimum,</hi> that is the moſt true that is moſt ancient. And the ground of this aſſertion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative, for the Truth is firſt layd, before Hereſie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in; good, it is <hi>ſubjectum mali,</hi> the ſubject whereto evill cleaveth, and muſt therefore needs be before it. Satan was firſt an Angell of Light before a Prince of Darkeneſſe: <hi>Adam</hi> was made upright, and then became crooked and corrupted through ſinne: The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt was truly taught, before it was depraved with the wicked glaſſes of the Scribes and Phariſies; and the Doctrine of the Goſpell was at the beginning taught in the truth thereof, howſoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:173668:134"/> the myſtery of iniquity beganne to worke, and it was infected with Arrianiſme, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorianiſme; and this Antiquity of the truth in regard of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, is taught by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 24. where he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Husbandman firſt ſoweth good ſeed in his field, then commeth the evill one and ſoweth tares; whereupon hee is termed <hi>ſuperſeminator,</hi> not ſimply a ſower, but a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wer upon, or among the wheat.</p>
            <p>For Application: wee may hencefor our comfort conclude (beloved) the worſhip of God maintained and practiſed in our Church to bee true worſhip, becauſe it is the ſame with the worſhip of the prime and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Witneſſes and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers of the Goſpell, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and ſuch as held Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them. The Papiſts are alwayes objecting to us, that wee are new upſtarts, but
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:173668:134" rendition="simple:additions"/> may truly ſay with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 24. 14. After the way they call hereſie, we worſhip God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving thoſe things which are written in the Goſpell; and this is a teſtimony to us of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee came to preach at Athens, ſet forth no other God to them, but him whom the whole City worſhipped, and yet was taken to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſetter forth of new gods, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 18. So wee, when wee preach the Faith of our firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and teach what the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell manifeſtly approveth, are by Papiſts condemned as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators, and brochers of a new Goſpell: But if we looke into the point well, wee ſhall finde that true of them which <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in his Apologetique ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the old Romans, <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datis ſemper antiquitatem, et no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve de die vivitis;</hi> they cry out of the old Religion as the trueſt
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:173668:135"/> and ſafeſt, &amp; yet practiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Religion, which though it hath filled the world for a great time, and found many ſubtill wits to defend it, is yet riſen up ſince the time of the Goſpels firſt publiſhing; and ſo though they hold the Doctrine beleeved by their fathers, grandfathers, and great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, yet we truly maintaine the truth delivered by the firſt preachers of the Goſpel. For example: Wee teach that Prayer is to bee made to God alone; this Doctrine is ancient, the Soripture every where ſheweth it, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth <note place="margin">Decult. ſa. c. 9</note> it; for having objected againſt Vowes made to Saints, that in the Scriptures the word (Vow) is taken for a Promiſe made to God, he anſwereth it thus, <hi>Cum ſcriberentur Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae ſanctae, nondum ceperat uſus vovendi ſanctis,</hi> when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were written, the cuſtom
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:173668:135" rendition="simple:additions"/> of vowing to Saints was not begunne, ſo that Saint-worſhip is new worſhip, not comming from the firſt Fathers. Againe, we adminiſter the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in both kinds to the people, not by halfes, as the Papiſts doe; and our reaſon is, It is moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Chriſt at the firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo ordained it; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſo expoundeth it; and <hi>Caſſander</hi> affirmeth, that for a thouſand yeares after Chriſt, all men communicated in both kinds, ſo that the mangling of the Sacrament is new worſhip. Againe, we ſay that Kings are chiefe Governours of all cauſes in the Church, and this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ancient; ſuch were the Kings of Iſrael and Iudah: and <hi>Paul</hi> bids, that <hi>every ſoule be ſubiect to the higher powers, Rom.</hi> 13. 1. This ſo held till the times of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> 175 years after Chriſt, who exalted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboveall that is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:173668:136"/> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the ſacred name of King or Emperour; ſo that power in the Pope of depoſing Kings, is not of the firſt Fathers. The ſame may be ſayd of the adoration of Images, which tooke authority from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Councell of Nice, 789 yeares after Chriſt; and of tranſubſtantiation not heard of till the Lateran Councell, 400 yeares ſince, and of other their Doctrines, if wee had time to examine them. Let them ceaſe therefore to object unto us the beginning of our Religion from <hi>Wickliffe, Huſſe, Luther, Calvin,</hi> and thoſe worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, who fetched truth out of the pit, wherein a long time ſhee had beene hidden, and cauſed us to worſhip after the manner of our firſt Fathers, and let them rather looke upon their owne hatching of new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and thruſting them upon the Church, whereby
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:173668:136"/> the truth once given to the Saints, was ſo much obſcured, that it could not bee knowne ſcarcely what the Fathers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped: and for our ſelves, let it ſtabliſh us in the truth of our Religion, that we have the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and the purer times, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Doctrines taught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, wee reject not, but admit Antiquity, and have an eye to what our Fathers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</p>
            <p>Thus you have what is good in this ſpeech of the Samaritan, let us now ſee what is bad in it, for that ſomething is bad in it, is manifeſt from that reply of our Saviour, <hi>verſ. 22.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:173668:137"/> in the Mountaine, which was not warrantable. The viciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of which reaſoning, that you may perceive, I muſt brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay before you the hiſtory of the Samaritans worſhipping in this mountaine.</p>
            <p>You heard before how that <hi>Iacob</hi> returning from his uncle <hi>Laban,</hi> in this Mountaine built an Altar and there offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; from which fact of his, in ſucceeding ages, this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine became a ſolemne place of worſhipping, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, by meanes of one <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat,</hi> a noted enemy of the Church of God, ſo often recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the booke of <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> who being a ſtranger to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; and ſo <hi>Manaſſes</hi> of the poſterity of the high Prieſt, marrying his daughter againſt the Law, built a ſtately Temple in this Mountaine, by the leave of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and conſecrated the ſaid <hi>Manaſſes,</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:173668:137"/> his ſonne in law, high Prieſt there; becauſe in the time of the reformation of that great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of joyning with Aliants, hee was either to part with his wife, or his Prieſt-hood in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. Here aroſe a great Schiſme betweene the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and the Ieroſolymitans; the one grounding upon Gods command, that Ieruſalem was the place of the Service of God, the other patronizing this mountaine from the authority of <hi>Iaecobs</hi> worſhipping; which contention being after brought before <hi>Ptolomaeus Philometor, Sabaeus,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> pleading for Samaria, and <hi>Andronious</hi> for Ieruſalem, hee proving out of the Law of God the right his Temple had, and they from Tradition the right of theirs, it was determined for Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: yet ſo did Schiſme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with the Samaritans, that ſtill they held their argument,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:173668:138"/> 
               <hi>Our fathers worſhipped in this Mountaeine,</hi> therefore we may worſhip there alſo. Thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth this woman amiſſe from a good example. <hi>Iacob,</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and holy man worſhipped God in every place where hee came (becauſe there was then no ſet place appointed for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip) and ſo in the Mountaine before Sichem; but the Samaritans abſurdly allege his example for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their worſhip there, becauſe God himſelfe after that commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 5. that they ſhould ſeeke the place which the Lord ſhould chooſe to put his Name in, thither ſhould they bring their burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings; which place at firſt was Shiloh, whither <hi>Elkanah</hi> went to ſacrifice to the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 3. and afterward Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, where <hi>Solomon</hi> built the Temple; which places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſigned, it was unlawfull
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:173668:138"/> to ſacrifice any where elſe, and therefore it was left as a blot to many the good Kings of Iudah, that though they did many things well, yet the high places were not removed, but the people ſacrificed in the high places.</p>
            <p>This being the hiſtory, wee may from hence obſerve how dangerous and uncertaine a thing it is for a man to bee led in any Religious Action onely by the Example of others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further weighing the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, or unlawfulneſſe of the Act it ſelfe, and that in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards: For, 1. If a man have done evill, to imitate his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt needs be naught; this womans forefathers, for ſome generations, did ill in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping upon Mount Gerazim, and ſhee doth ill in following them. 2. If a man have done well, yet may another doe evill in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, for want of duly
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:173668:139"/> conſidering ſome circumſtance which may marre the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; thus <hi>Iacob</hi> did well to worſhip in this mountaine, but the Samaritans, and this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man erred in worſhipping there, becauſe the prohibition of God came betweene, which was not in force in <hi>Iacobs</hi> daies, but afterwards.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is dangerous following Examples, if they be ill; for, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, a man may bee eaſily thus miſtaken; hee may give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to imitate one who may pretend much, and make great ſhewes, and yet bring forth but an evill effect in the end: It was a doubtfull ſpeech in it ſelfe which <hi>Ruth</hi> ſpake to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

It is Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> counſell to try the ſpirits whom wee follow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe falſe ſpirits are gone into the world, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 1. Into Schiſme; thus many fall daily
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:173668:140"/> into Browniſme and ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe they ſee ſome whom they account holy men, to doe ſo; not obſerving what pride of ſpirit, what conceited diſcontent hath put them out of their right Bias; and ſo, like ſilly ſheepe, if one goe, the reſt will after, though it be to the ſlaughter-houſe: Into wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; thus when <hi>Ieho ſhaphat</hi> would be like <hi>Ahab,</hi> hee did what God was diſpleaſed with, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 4. and wee ſee it by wofull experience daily in many, eſpecially young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they give themſelves up to the faſhions of roaring boyes, and the great maſters of iniquity, till, if the Mercy of God bee not the greater, they fall into hell e're they bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. Beloved, let us learne to follow men, as they follow Chriſt, and no further; chooſe out for patternes men of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, men of vertue, thoſe you

            <p n="2">2. It is dangerous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine to give too much to examples, though they be good, for there are many obſervable circumſtances which may make a man erre in doing that, which another man did, and erred not; The Philoſopher tells us, that examples muſt be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> both in the ſame kinde, or elſe they warrant nothing; in the ſame kinde, I ſay, in regard of many circumſtances: I will name theſe five; the perſon doing, the thing done, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom, the time when, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:173668:141"/> of another.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Examples muſt be the ſame in regard of the perſon doing, for all men ſtand not in like reference in reſpect of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: he ſaid well in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, <hi>Hoc licet impune facere huic, illi non licet; non quia diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Examples muſt bee of the ſame kind in regard of the thing that is done, elſe inſtead of a fiſh, a man may take a ſtone; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an egge, a ſerpent, and ſo manifeſtly deceive himſelfe in that which hee doth upon ſo unſound a warrant: It was an excellent worke of <hi>David</hi> to provide inſtruments of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, Harpes, Cymbals, and ſuch like, to be uſed in ſounding out the prayſes of God; but when Drunkards furniſhed themſelves with laſcivious and wanton Muſicke, and patrona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it by the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the Prophet denounceth a

Wo to thoſe that invent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Inſtruments of Muſicke, like David:</hi> His Inſtruments were holy, theirs unholy; his ſongs Divine, theirs prophane; they had no reaſon to ſhrowd themſelves under the example of <hi>David,</hi> the thing done, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed like Harpe and Harrow, as it is in the proverbe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Examples muſt be of the ſame kinde, in regard of the perſon to whom a thing is done; for oft times a thing is well done in regard of one, which would be ill done in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of another: hee were a ſtrange Phyſician, and ſuch they ſay, are many Empyricks, who ſeeing a man of rare skill giving a Potion to a ſicke Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, whoſe diſeaſe and ſtate of body hee knowes full well, would give the ſame to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, peradventure, hath not the ſame diſeaſe; or if hee
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:173668:142"/> have, is not of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to beare the Phyſicke: If, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8. 24. telling him that hee was in the gall of bitterneſſe and bonds of iniquity, and that hee had no part or portion in the Goſpell, wee ſhould therefore ſay the ſame to every ſinner, we might ſoone breake the bruiſed reed, ſoone quench the ſmoking flax, and curſe where God hath not curſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Examples muſt be of the ſame kinde, in regard of the time; for every thing hath his ſeaſon, and what profiteth now, may hurt anon: There was a manner of Gods Worſhip inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in old time, which muſt not now be uſed; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, <hi>Tempora mutantur,</hi> times are not now the ſame they were then. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in one of his Epiſtles ſheweth this by a very pregnant exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:173668:143"/> There was (ſaith he) in my time, one <hi>Vindicianus</hi> a Phyſician of great note, who applyed to his Patients griefe what hee thought fitting for him, and it cured him: ſome yeares after, this Patient falling ſicke of his old malady, would needs bee his owne Phyſician, and give the ſame phyſicke to himſelfe; <hi>adhibitum vertit in peius,</hi> he tooke it, and was the worſe for it: hereupon hee runnes to <hi>Vindicianus,</hi> and tels him the matter; he anſwered, This was fallen to him, becauſe hee bade him not doe it. The man thought he was ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, who could worke better by his words than by his art, till hee told him at length in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, <hi>Ego illi aetati hoc nunquam eram iuſſurus;</hi> I would never have bidden you take that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine at thoſe yeares. You ſee by this the great force of time, a neceſſary circumſtance to be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:173668:143"/> obſerved in all examples.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Examples muſt be of the ſame kinde in regard of the end of the action, or elſe herein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they will faile groſſely: The Prophet <hi>David</hi> did well, and moveth by the Spirit of God, when as hee ſo often curſeth his enemies, and uſeth direfull imprecations againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was raviſhed with a vehement deſire of the glory of God, and ſought that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, without any deſire of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revenge, yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth us bleſſe our enemies, <hi>Bleſſe and curſe not;</hi> becauſe wee are not ſo extraordinary filled with true zeale, but curſe our enemies, out of anger, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and thirſting to have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance taken on them. Thus you ſee the five Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which muſt be obſerved in our imitation, which may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſhew what I intended by them, how uncertaine a
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:173668:144"/> thing it is for any man to guide his courſe meerely by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; where, be the thing never ſo good that is followed, there are notwithſtanding ſo many wayes to goe amiſſe from it.</p>
            <p>Pittifull therefore was the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of this woman, and of her fellow Citizens, who had no better than this Lesbian rule to ſquare their worſhip by, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at their fathers who had paſſed ſo many yeares agoe; ſince when, the ſtate of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had beene changed, and Mount Gerazim now become prophane, which was unto <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> holy ground; but well was it with the Iewes who worſhip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped what they knew, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed out of the Law of God, that Ieruſalem was the place where men ought to worſhip; it was indeed the beſt hold they could have, and therefore <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus,</hi> pleading their cauſe, though hee alleaged the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

            <p>Let us, beloved, though looke into our Fathers Worſhip, yet not ſo dote upon it, as we had rather erre with them, than doe rightly, according as the grace of God, the Word of ſalvation ſhining forth, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth us: Be it that they did many things excellently, yet they were men, and in many things did amiſſe: wee have, God be thanked, as the Iewes had, <gap reason="foreign">
